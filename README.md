picaxe-fan-controller
=====================

A circuit and some picaxe bas code that PWMs a 5V DC fan for a fixed period of time.
This project was created so my locker at work would have extra ventillation :)

The circuit uses a PICAXE-08M2.

Circuit (drawn with DigiKey's SchemeIt tool):

Use the PICAXE programming editor to program the PICAXE08M2, then wire up a circuit board as per the schematic.

Tips: check the pinouts on the 2N7000 before soldering, not all 2N7000s have the same packaging!
